# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on **customer segmentation**, analyzing how customers behave to identify distinct segments within a customer base. By understanding customer behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.

## Project Structure

- Data Preparation: This section involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Here, the data is explored to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among different features.
- Segmentation: The core of the project where customers are segmented based on their behavior using various clustering techniques.
- Analysis of Segments: Each segment is analyzed to understand the characteristics and behaviors that define it.
- Conclusion & Recommendations: Insights from the segmentation analysis are summarized, and recommendations for business actions are provided.

## Key Techniques and Tools

- Clustering Algorithms:K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, etc.
- Data Visualization: Techniques to visualize customer segments and their behaviors.
- Feature Engineering: Creating features that best capture customer behaviors for effective segmentation.

## How to Run

1. Environment Setup: Ensure that you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt`.
2. Data: The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `data` directory.
3. Run the Notebook: Execute the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

The project identifies several distinct customer segments, each characterized by unique behaviors. The findings provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.

## Future Work

Potential future directions include:
- Integrating additional data sources for richer segmentation.
- Experimenting with advanced clustering techniques or deep learning methods.
